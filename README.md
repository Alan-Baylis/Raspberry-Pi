Raspberry Pi Files
==================

The [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) model B is a $35 computer.

This repository currently contains an [LDraw](http://www.ldraw.org/) model of the LEGO case I built for my Raspberry Pi.

You can find more pictures of my Raspberry Pi and my LEGO case in [this Flickr gallery](http://www.flickr.com/photos/anoved/sets/72157634034196004/).
